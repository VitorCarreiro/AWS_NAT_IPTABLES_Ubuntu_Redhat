**Now go to the terminal and start doing those commands**

**You need to enable IP forwarding if you want to be capable of forwarding packets to other destinations, go to `nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf`**

`Uncomment "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1"`

**Do this to check if its correct then save it with**
```
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sysctl -p
```
**Install iptables and netfilter-persistent**

`apt install netfilter-persistent iptables-persistent`

**Do POSTROUTING MASQUERADE to allow route traffic without disrupting the original one**
```
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
systemctl restart iptables
netfilter-persistent save
```

**Go to `nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` and add the gateway of your server, if you have DNS installed place the nameservers section if you don't have it don't place it**

                use-routes: false
            routes:
              - to: 0.0.0.0/0
